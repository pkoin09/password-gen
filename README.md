# PASSWORD GENERATOR WITH QR CODE

## [Video Demo](https://youtu.be/2p_tIesIkI0)

#### Description:

This Python program provides a solution for generating secure random passwords of any desired length. Along with generating the password, the program creates scannable QR code that corresponds to the generated password. For convenience, the password and QR code can be saved as a PDF file, making it easy to store and share. Moreover, the program offers a feature that allows users to seamlessly send the generated password and QR code PDF via email, using the sender's (the person who generated the password) Gmail account.

The program will create a strong and secure password, the longer the password, the more secure it will be. You can use the generated password for any app that requires a password. A good example would be the guest password to your wi-fi. This can be posted in the guest area or in your home for easy access to guests.
